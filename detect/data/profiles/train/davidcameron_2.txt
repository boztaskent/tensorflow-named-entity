Dundee drug boss jailed for trafficking

Dundee Sheriff Court
Cameron was jailed at Dundee Sheriff Court
The head of a drug trafficking gang that supplied large quantities of heroin and cannabis to drug users in Dundee has been jailed.
David Cameron, 63, was sentenced to three and a half years at Dundee Sheriff Court for his part in the operation.
The court heard Cameron and his family would bring the drugs to the city from England every three weeks.
He was caught following a surveillance operation by Tayside Police.
Among those working for Cameron were his two daughters and their partners.
'Behind bars'
Theresa Cameron was previously jailed for three years and four months for her part in the operation, which dated back to 2008, while her sister Linda was given a nine-month restriction of liberty order.
David McLure was jailed for 20 months and Phillip Allan given a nine-month restriction of liberty order.
During the police operation to catch the gang, officers recovered drugs with an estimated street value of nearly £40,000.
Det Insp Stuart Holmes said: "'As a result of our investigations a drug dealer and several of his 'workers' are now behind bars where they belong.
"The amount of drugs seized provides an indication of the scale of illegal drugs trafficking that they were responsible for."
