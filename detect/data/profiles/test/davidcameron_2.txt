33 Crown Prosecutor Harry Mallalieu and his chum Judge David Cameron

“It’s very silly to take the police on – do you know why? Because you’ll never win.” Judge David Cameron.

“I recall in his defended hearing he was quite open about his dislike of police.”

Judge Cameron said it was a “very foolish attitude to have”.

In other words, It pays to hide your contempt of bentcops and equally bent Judges when you are in David Cameron’s Court.

At the time of sentencing, on March 5 2013, Judge Cameron said brandishing and discharging a firearm in a public place needed to be met by a stern response from the courts, “even more so when it’s pointed directly at people”. Except when it’s Stephen Poynter holding/firing the gun at or near a vdL family member.

These cases more often than not reek of collusion on the part of the police, crown law and the courts responsible for the decisions. Judicial connivance.

The judge in my case could, and did, cheat. Crown prosecutors and  police could, and did, cheat. And once they coordinated their cheating, no fact, law or procedure could save me. I was set up to lose.

When you think of a “corrupt” judge, you may think of one who trades rulings for cash. As far as we know, that obvious sort of corruption is rare. You must appreciate however, that corruption may take subtle but equally destructive forms.

Among other things, a dishonest judge can ignore evidence, twist rules and procedure, obstruct the record, retaliate, manufacture facts or ignore others, allow infirm claims or dismiss valid ones, deny admission of evidence prejudicial to the favoured party, suborn perjury, mischaracterize pleadings, engage in ex parte communication and misapply the law.

When he or she does these things intentionally, (motivation is a separate issue) he commits a crime. Petty or grand, the acts are still crimes. It takes surprisingly little to “steer” a case.

New Zealand’s political movers and shakers have been very slow to wake up to a new reality, that being that there are now a great many foreign eyes watching their every move, their thoroughly corrupt behaviour and the actions of New Zealand’s corrupt police force and it’s politically active ever so obliging bent judiciary.

IN ANOTHER TIME AND ANOTHER PLACE THEY’D BE CLICKING THEIR HEALS WITH THE WORST OF THEM.

I, DAVID CAMERON swear that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors, according to law, in the office of District Court Judge; and I will do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of New Zealand without fear or favour, affection or ill will. So help me God.”

Dear Ms Yvonne Nyenhuis

This is a very serious complaint against your Branch Vice President Harry Mallalieu.

I refer to the Court record where the Crown Prosecutor Harry Mallalieu asks Crown witness Stephen Poynter a few leading and Court misleading questions. See attached Court documents.

Q   Now if I could take you back to August of 2011, the first being the 3rd of August?

A   Hmm

Q   Do you recall particular use of your firearm on that day?

A   No I don’t, no, I mean, I’ve, you know, it doesn’t, that day to any other day is just a-     [A stupid liar struggling and failing to come up with a plausible lie]

Q   So you wouldn’t be able to tell us exactly what you were doing-

A   On that day?

Q    -shooting on that day?

A   No.

If you refer to his attached Brief of Evidence signed and dated 7/5/2012 you will see that Poynter did remember what he did that day the 3rd of August. But Mr Mallalieu knowing that Poynter was lying with his final “No” answer was satisfied with Poynter’s false replies and moved quickly on to his next attempt to pervert the course of justice.

.

Q And what about the 23rd of August?

A   Ah, I think it says there that I was, I would’ve rung the police and said what was happening so if I was – if there was being a home kill done with a pig then that’s what I would’ve been doing, yeah.

Q   But you don’t specifically remember that date because –

A   Well no.

Q   – a long time ago I suppose?

A     A long time ago and they weren’t, they were just a, just another occurrence. Another event.

I have highlighted part of the above sentence because when Poynter said that he was letting slip that he had been reading his attached Brief of Evidence just prior to taking the witness stand and that he was fully conversant with it and that the Crown Prosecutor induced answer that he could not remember what he was doing that day was another deliberate lie.

So what we have here is Officer of the Court, Crown Prosecutor and Whanganui Law Society Branch Vice President Harry Mallialieu twice attempting to pervert the course of justice by firstly, knowingly and willingly eliciting false testimony from a sworn witness and then again by contradicting that same witness’s true testimony with another attempt  to nullify that testimony by again introducing the false notion that Poynter’s memory of what he did that day was either faulty or non existent.   It is clear from the Court record that Poynter told the Court that he did remember what happened that day, the 23rd of August 2011. He told the Court that he’d rung the police and told them he was intending to home kill a pig, but Mr Mallialieu then attempted to muddy the waters with a question very similar to his earlier one, “So you wouldn’t be able to tell us exactly what you were doing-“. This time he asked Poynter, “But you don’t specifically remember that date because -“, and he asked that leading question solely to get another no answer in order to mislead the Court into accepting the lie that Poynter suffers from a noticeable form of time induced memory loss and also to make sure that Poynter was fully aware that Judge Cameron wouldn’t censure him if he continued to feign memory loss when he didn’t want to answer awkward questions during cross-examination. From that time on whenever Poynter didn’t want to answer a question with a provable lie he either feigned memory loss or deflected the question with, “the Police will have those records.”

Also, Mr Mallialieu asked Poynter the Court recorded question, “But you don’t specifically remember that date because -“, because he was fully aware that Poynter was acting illegally and contrary to written police instructions when he fired his high-powered 243 rifle FOUR times on the night of the third of August 2011 and had lied to police about it in his attached Brief of Evidence. See attached Police instructions. So that makes it three, and if you accept the above underlined sentence as correct, four times in the space of about 1 minute that your Mr Mallialieu attempted to pervert the course of justice in a Court of law.

It’s all there in black and white, no ifs and no buts; the red herrings about remembering or failing to remember what happened on SPECIFIC dates do not rule out the instances of serious malfeasance in any way.

Yours truly,
