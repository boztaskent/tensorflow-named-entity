Restless Conservative backbenchers are asking what might happen in the days after the EU referendum result – with talk among some them over whether it will trigger a vote of confidence in David Cameron. A leadership ballot would take place if 50 MPs request it by letter from Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee of backbenchers; the likelihood of that happening depends on the referendum result.

What could happen in each of the three main scenarios being talked about?

A narrow victory for remain
This is the outcome that is seen as the most risky for Cameron in Westminster. A narrow win could lead to backlash and resentment about the prime minister’s tactics, which many feel have been over the top.

John Redwood, the senior Tory MP and former leadership contender, delivered a warning shot to Cameron to tone down his campaigning. He wrote on his blog: “As he wishes to remain prime minister, he has to remember that the prime minister has to speak as best he can for the whole nation. As party leader he has to speak for the majority of his party.”

Asked whether Cameron would face a leadership challenge whether or not he loses, Redwood said: “I am an optimist. I am giving him measured and sensible advice having watched leaders over the years … I don’t want to get drawn into ‘what ifs’. It is my advice that he will find it easier to put the party together again if he is not leading a partisan campaign on staying in Europe, particularly as he said it was a close call and he could have gone the other way.”

A close cabinet colleague agreed that a narrow win could be the most dangerous, putting the party in a “really difficult position”. The colleague added: “They need 50 names [for a vote of confidence] and whether they gets it all depends on the margin – if is is a tight win for remain, people will feel they were robbed.”

It is likely that, even if they get 50 names, the prime minister will survive the confidence vote. But the very fact of it happening would be hugely destabilising to his leadership.

It is how some Conservative leaders have met their end. Take what happened to Margaret Thatcher whose leadership was first damaged when Sir Anthony Meyer became a “stalking horse” challenger in 1989, with dozens of backbenchers refusing to support her.

However, the real blow to Thatcher came when Geoffrey Howe resigned as deputy prime minister and Michael Heseltine launched a formal challenge. She resigned before there was a second round of the ballot as support from senior party figures started to drop away.

Iain Duncan Smith called on his critics to unite or get enough letters of no confidence to spark a contest after months of speculation about his leadership in 2003. This was duly done and he lost the ensuing vote of MPs by about 90 to 75.

As for John Major, he faced a leadership challenge from Redwood in 1995, and resigned to take on his critics. He won that battle by 218 to 89 although he went on to lose the 1997 election and resign again shortly afterwards.

Solid win for remain
This is the safest result for Cameron. The prime minister has taken a heavy and visible role in the remain camp, touring the country, giving speeches, coordinating business voices and even welcoming the interventions of foreign leaders.

In early March, he stood next to France president François Hollande as he threatened that Brexit could lead to the tearing up of a treaty with France that prevents migrants crossing the Channel at Calais.

However, many Brexit campaigners – including Conservative voices – feel the prime minister has been over the top,. A cabinet minister in favour of remain told the Guardian that it was unlikely that France would reverse the Le Touquet treaty.

Yet, while people like Redwood and Duncan Smith would still be upset about the tactics of those campaigning for in, one cabinet member believes that “most others, including ministers, would say ‘OK it is clear’.”

Even so, Cameron’s position may have been weakened by the weeks of bitter infighting within the party, by his admission he does not want to stay on as prime minister beyond 2020 and by the resentment he has caused among the pro-Brexit camp for passionately campaigning to remain.

There are some voices beginning to agitate for leadership contest. Alexander Temerko, a major Tory donor and backer of Boris Johnson, wrote in the Guardian on Thursday that the party was fracturing and “the infighting that’s likely to follow the referendum could be disastrous without any uniting influence”. He said his recommendation was “a leadership election immediately after the vote in June to unite MPs and members”.

Some Eurosceptic Tory MPs are also arguing that they will need a Eurosceptic prime minister in the event of Brexit to deal with a “tsunami” of EU legislation they believe Brussels has been saving up during the period of referendum uncertainty.

Brexit
Many expect Cameron to resign in this situation, and he will certainly come under huge pressure from the Labour party to do so. But when asked whether he would during prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons, his quick and sharp answer has been “no”. Perhaps Cameron believes he ought to see the process of leaving – which could take years – through.

He could yet have unlikely support from Eurosceptics in his party at this point. Take the view of Brady, the 1922 chair, who thinks it is important that people do not think Brexit will cause crisis in the UK. He argued that it was “very important” that Cameron remain, so that there is a period of stability, and an experienced team to deal with the renegotiation.

Other less practically minded MPs would see it as the golden opportunity to get rid of a prime minister from the modernising wing of the party, who they have never liked, and replace him with a full-blooded Eurosceptic.

A swift challenge after the contest would boost the chances of leadership contenders those who campaigned victoriously for an EU exit at a time when pro-in candidates, most notably George Osborne, would be marginalised. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, made a calculated choice to campaign for Brexit, despite some of his old friends claiming he was really an ‘inner’.

If Cameron does choose to resign or faces a no-confidence vote, that has put Johnson in an ideal place to win over the Eurosceptic Conservative grassroots who will choose the next leader from a shortlist of two drawn up by the parliamentary party.

There is no shortage of talk among Conservatives MPs about trying to round up letters of no confidence in Cameron – and there is growing support for a Boris Johnson-Michael Gove joint ticket.

If Cameron stayed on, in effect as a caretaker leader, that could give some recovery time to the possible leadership contenders who campaigned to stay in the EU – such as George Osborne, Stephen Crabb, Nicky Morgan and Sajid Javid. Their chances of succeeding the prime minister might be damaged by a Brexit vote.
